# Opside-Chain Consensus Client Based on Prysm Fork
This is the core library of the [Opside-Chain](https://opside.network/) consensus client, based on the Prysm fork developed by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com/). It is a [Golang](https://golang.org/) implementation of the [Ethereum Consensus Specifications](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/). For detailed information about the latest version and upcoming significant changes, please refer to the [Changelog](https://github.com/opside-protocol/opside-prysm/releases).

## Getting Started

A detailed set of installation and usage instructions, as well as a breakdown of each individual component, is provided in the [Official Documentation Portal](https://docs.opside.network/). If you still have questions, feel free to visit our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/opsidezk).

## Staking on Pre-alpha Testnet

To participate in staking, you can join the [Official Launchpad](https://opside.network/validator/deposit). The Launchpad is the recommended way to become a validator at this stage.

Test tokens can be obtained from the official [Faucet](https://mirror.xyz/opsidezk.eth/mezUUwj4jATth8zrsdKHc-PjsE3bs5j8j7JY15rsZNU).

### How to Run a Node

For running nodes, we offer a simple and easy-to-use deployment environment. You can refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.opside.network/validators-pos/run-a-validator/ubuntu-recommended/validator-program-v3). We also provide a [Control Panel Script](https://docs.opside.network/validators-pos/validator-control-dashboard) to simplify the daily maintenance operations for users.

For some common questions, you can refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.opside.network/validators-pos/validator-faq).
